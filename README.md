Facial recognition proyect.

This project will consist of a Raspberry Pi Pico connected to an NRF24L01 and a HMB010 camera that will send the captured image to another Raspberry Pi Pico connected to an NRF24L01. The image is then sent to a flask server which decides whether or not the image is a face.
